How could you make the equalizer graph more visually appealing?
- The ability to zoom in and out on the graphs.
- Better looking graphs
- Add values to the axis
- Borders on the graph
- Let them know what they are looking at (titles)

If you made the FFT longer, would your program still work properly? Why?
- Yes, because the FFT generates the values

If you wanted to change the functionality of this program to show an equalizer of a song playing (like the RollingStones satisfaction song), then what code would you need to change? Is it an easy change to make (why or why not)?
- Yes, all you would have to do is change the input to the audio file.

Is pausing the audioManager object better than deallocating it when the view has disappeared (why or why not)?
- Yes, because deallocation and allocation is costly and requires more memory.
